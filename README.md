# Recyclable Recognition

Most people do not know what is recyclable or not, and this hurts the environment as products that could have been recycled are sitting in landfills across the world. To help end this and further the theme of justice, our team decided to create an app to inform users what is recyclable and what is not. This app uses an Android phone's camera to help a user identify if items are recyclable or trash. This app was made possible by Clarifai, which is how we identify which objects are in the image to process whether they are recyclable or not. 

Disclaimer: This app was built in 10 hours, so there may be misclassifications! In our testing, most items were marked correctly.
